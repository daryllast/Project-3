To Do List and Contact Form Using React

Overview/Description About This Project:

In this project we were asked to design a To Do List App and Contact Form. In the app, the user should be able to add list items, remove/make the item disappear from the list, and mark list items as complete. In addition, we needed to make a page that allows a user to complete a contact form. In the form they should be able to submit their information and a message/comment. 

How to Use the App/What Functionality it Offers:
The app is simple. The user can type in their list items. If they want to change them they can click the icons “X” for delete and “pencil and paper” to edit the item. When they wish to update the item they will be able to type in the item they wish to add. The user can also click the item and it will get darker to show that this item has been completed. The contact form is simple, they just click on the Contact form from the navigation bar and fill in the information below. Once they have filled in the information, the user can submit.

Technologies Used:
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, NPM, GitHub, VS Code, JSON, Node (Dependencies)

Ideas for Future Improvement: 
-	Have components on separate files to stay organized. 
-	Understanding how to manipulate the DOM when using JavaScript and React. 
-	More Interactivity to ensure the user has a great experience.
-	Including Bootstrap integration 

User Story: To Do App

Users will have the view of a plain navigation bar that can go to the home, to do list, and the contact form. When the user clicks the to do list, they will get to the to do list form. The user will be able to use field to enter their task. When they enter the task, they can press the button add. This will be added to the list below. The list item will also have icons indicating that it can be deleted (with the X) and edited (with the pencil and paper icon). The user can click either icon to delete or edit. When a user clicks edit it will have a field for them to update their list item and click update. Once the update has been made the user will be returned to the list and the list item will be in the list. The user can also click the list item and it will get darker and appear crossed out. This will allow the user to show they have completed and item on the list without removing the item entirely. 

User Story for the Contact Page

When users use the contact page they will have the contact form clicked from the navigation bar. The user will be able to easily use this form. Each field allows the user to type in their first name, last name, email address, and a message. They then can click and submit the form. The form will be submitted and sent to formspree where we can see all the users that have submitted their form.
